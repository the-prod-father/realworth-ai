## POST 1: r/Antiques
**Subreddit culture:** Knowledgeable collectors, skeptical of quick answers, value expertise
**Post type:** Discussion / soft share
**Wait 1-2 weeks before posting** — comment helpfully first

### Title:
```
Been experimenting with AI appraisals — here's what I've learned about accuracy vs. expert opinions
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/Antiques,

I've spent the last few months building an AI tool that appraises items from photos (I know, I know — hear me out).

I wanted to share what I've learned, because I think this community would have strong (and fair) opinions.

**What AI gets right:**
- Quick identification of era, style, and origin
- Pulling comparable sales data from auction records
- Spotting obvious reproductions
- Giving a realistic value RANGE rather than a single number

**What AI still struggles with:**
- Detecting subtle restoration or repairs
- Understanding regional market variations
- The "intangibles" — provenance, story, collector sentiment
- Truly rare items with limited comparables

**My honest take:** AI won't replace experts for serious pieces. But for the 90% of items people wonder about — the "is this worth getting professionally appraised?" question — it's surprisingly useful as a first filter.

Would love to hear your thoughts. What would make something like this actually useful to this community?

(For anyone curious, the tool is at realworth.ai — 10 free appraisals/month. No pressure, just sharing what I've been working on.)
```

## POST 2: r/ThriftStoreHauls
**Subreddit culture:** Excitement about finds, "look what I got for $X!", supportive
**Post type:** Story / discovery
**Image required:** Show actual items

### Title:
```
Thrifted this for $4 — AI says it might be worth $300+. Am I being scammed by a robot? 🤖
```

### Body:
```
Found this [item] at Goodwill last week. Grabbed it because it looked cool, didn't think much of it.

Got curious and ran it through an AI appraisal thing (realworth.ai — it's free).

It came back saying it's a [specific identification] from [era], estimated $250-350 based on similar sold items.

I'm skeptical but also... hopeful?

Has anyone else used AI for appraisals? Is this thing accurate or am I getting my hopes up for nothing?

```

**Why this works:** Asks for community validation, shares a discovery, doesn't claim expertise

## POST 3: r/Flipping
**Subreddit culture:** Profit-driven, tool-obsessed, loves efficiency hacks
**Post type:** Resource share / tool recommendation
**Be direct** — this community appreciates practicality

### Title:
```
Free tool that's saved me hours on appraisals — thought I'd share
```

### Body:
```
Hey flippers,

Wanted to share something that's been useful for my sourcing workflow.

I've been using an AI appraisal tool (realworth.ai) to quickly check items before I buy. Photo → 30 seconds → estimated value with sold comps.

**Where it's actually useful:**
- Estate sales when you need to decide fast
- Bulk lots where you can't research every item
- "Is this worth my time?" gut checks
- Identifying items you don't recognize

**Where it's NOT useful:**
- High-value items (still do your research)
- Anything where condition nuances matter
- Categories with volatile pricing

It's free (10 appraisals/month) so there's no risk to try. I've found maybe 3-4 sleeper items I would've passed on otherwise.

Not affiliated with the company, just a tool that's worked for me. Anyone else tried AI appraisal tools?
```

**Note:** Be prepared to answer "are you the creator?" honestly. Say: "Actually yeah, I built it. Wanted to share because I think it's genuinely useful for this use case."

## POST 4: r/whatsthisworth
**Subreddit culture:** Direct help requests, community valuations, practical
**Post type:** Offer to help + soft mention
**Strategy:** Comment on OTHER people's posts first, then make your own

### Comment Strategy (Do This First):
Find 5-10 posts asking for valuations. Provide helpful, detailed answers. After building karma/trust, make your post.

### Title:
```
I built a free AI appraisal tool — happy to run any items through it if you want a second opinion
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/whatsthisworth,

I've been lurking here for a while and love how helpful this community is.

I built an AI appraisal tool (realworth.ai) that analyzes photos and pulls comparable sales data. It's free to use (10/month).

**Offer:** If anyone wants me to run their item through it for a second data point alongside the community's opinions, drop a comment or DM me a photo. I'll share what the AI says + the comparable sales it found.

Not trying to replace the expertise here — just thought it might be a useful additional perspective, especially for items where finding sold comps is tricky.

(And yes, I built it, so I'm biased. But I genuinely want to know if it's helpful or if it's missing the mark.)
```

## POST 5: r/Vintage
**Subreddit culture:** Aesthetic appreciation, stories, "the hunt"
**Post type:** Visual story with discovery
**Image required:** Beautiful shot of vintage item

### Title:
```
Finally identified my grandmother's mystery piece — turns out she had great taste
```

### Body:
```
My grandmother passed a few years ago and left behind this [item]. Nobody in the family knew what it was or if it was valuable.

I finally got curious enough to do some research. Used an AI appraisal tool (realworth.ai) and it identified it as a [specific item] from [era/maker].

Estimated value: $XXX-XXX

But honestly? I don't think I'd ever sell it. Just nice to finally know what she had.

Anyone else have pieces from family that turned out to be more interesting than expected?

```

**Why this works:** Emotional story, not about money, invites community sharing

## HANDLING COMMENTS

### "Are you the creator/affiliated?"
```
Yeah, I built it! Wanted to share because I think it's genuinely useful. Happy to answer any questions about how it works or take feedback on what's missing.
```

### "This is just an ad"
```
Fair point — I get the skepticism. I tried to share what I've actually learned rather than just pitch. But I hear you. Mods, feel free to remove if this crosses a line.
```

### "AI will never replace experts"
```
Totally agree for serious pieces. I see this more as a first filter — the "should I even bother researching this more?" question. For anything valuable, you'd still want an expert.
```

### "How does it work?"
```
It uses image recognition + a large language model trained on auction records and collector databases. Analyzes the photo, identifies what it likely is, then pulls comparable sales data. Not perfect, but surprisingly useful for common items.
```

### "I tried it and it was wrong"
```
Appreciate the feedback — what category was the item? I'm still improving it and specific examples help. Mind sharing what it got wrong vs. the actual value?
```
