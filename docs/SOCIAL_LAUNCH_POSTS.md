For 10 years, I had a box of old baseball cards sitting in my closet.

"Probably worthless," I told myself.

Last week, I finally got them appraised: $2,847.

No expert appointments. No auction house fees. No waiting.

Just AI and a phone camera. 30 seconds per card.

We built RealWorth to answer the question everyone with "stuff" has been afraid to ask:

"What is this actually worth?"

## POST 2: The Pain Point
**Best for:** Twitter & LinkedIn
**Angle:** Problem-aware audience
**When to post:** Launch day +1, afternoon (2pm local)

### Twitter Version:
```
The old way to appraise stuff:

- Google for 2 hours
- Find conflicting information
- Pay $50+ for an expert
- Wait 3-5 business days
- Still feel unsure

The new way:

- Take a photo
- Wait 30 seconds
- Get detailed valuation with market comps

realworth.ai
```

### LinkedIn Version:
```
I used to think getting something appraised meant:

- Driving to an antique shop
- Hoping they're honest about the value
- Paying $50+ for a "professional opinion"
- Still googling afterward to verify

That's why we built RealWorth.

Upload a photo. Get an AI-powered appraisal in 30 seconds. See actual market comparisons from real sales.

No appointments. No gatekeepers. No BS.

What's that thing in your closet actually worth?

## POST 3: The Curiosity Hook
**Best for:** Twitter (high engagement)
**Angle:** Interactive / engagement bait
**When to post:** Launch day +2, evening (6pm local)

### Twitter Version:
```
That thing you inherited from your grandparents.

The one you've always wondered about.

The one that's been sitting in a box for years.

What if you could finally know what it's worth?

30 seconds. Free.

realworth.ai

(Reply with what you'd appraise first)
```

### LinkedIn Version:
```
Everyone has THAT item.

The one inherited from a relative. The garage sale find. The "I should probably get this looked at someday" thing.

You've googled it. You've wondered. But you've never actually found out what it's worth.

Why?

Because appraisals are expensive, inconvenient, and honestly... intimidating.

What if it takes 30 seconds and costs nothing?

That's RealWorth.

Here's exactly what you get when you appraise something on RealWorth:

1. **Estimated Value Range** — Not a single guess, but a realistic spread

2. **Historical Context** — When it was made, where it's from, why it matters

3. **Condition Analysis** — What affects the value up or down

4. **Market Comparisons** — Real prices from actual sales (not made up)

5. **AI Follow-Up Chat** — Ask "Where should I sell this?" or "Is this authentic?"

All from a single photo. In about 30 seconds.

We've already appraised thousands of items — from $5 trinkets to $10,000+ finds.

What's hiding in your closet?

## POST 5: The Social Proof / FOMO
**Best for:** Twitter & LinkedIn
**Angle:** Traction + urgency
**When to post:** Launch day +4, afternoon (3pm local)

### Twitter Version:
```
In the last week, RealWorth users have discovered:

- A $3 garage sale find worth $450
- Grandma's "old junk" valued at $1,200
- A book collection worth more than a used car

What are you sitting on?

10 free appraisals/month. No credit card.

realworth.ai
```

### LinkedIn Version:
```
Some things RealWorth users have discovered this week:

- A $3 garage sale vase → Actually worth $450
- "Just some old books" → $2,100 first edition set
- Inherited jewelry → Insurance value of $3,500
- Attic baseball cards → $800 in hidden gems

The pattern?

People dramatically underestimate what their stuff is worth.

And they've been too intimidated (or too busy) to find out.

RealWorth changes that.

Photo → 30 seconds → Know what you have.

10 free appraisals every month. No credit card required.

## BONUS: Thread/Carousel for High Engagement
**Best for:** Twitter thread or LinkedIn carousel
**When to post:** Weekend or slow news day

### Twitter Thread:
```
🧵 5 things people don't realize about the stuff in their homes:

1/ That vintage Pyrex your mom used?
Some patterns sell for $500+.
Especially the "rare" colors from the 60s.

2/ First edition books aren't always valuable.
But some $2 thrift finds are worth $1,000+.
Condition and demand matter more than age.

3/ Old toys in original packaging?
We've seen Hot Wheels worth more than actual cars.

4/ "Antique" doesn't automatically mean valuable.
A mass-produced 1920s item might be worth less than a rare 1990s collectible.

5/ Most people never find out what their stuff is worth.
Because appraisals are expensive, slow, and intimidating.

That's why we built @RealWorthAI.

Photo → 30 seconds → Know what you have.
