## RealWorth.ai Launches AI-Powered Treasure Discovery Platform That Turns Everyday Items Into Found Money

*The gamified appraisal app helps people discover the hidden value in their closets, attics, and garages — one photo at a time*

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA** — Today, Why Not Us Labs announced the public launch of RealWorth.ai, an AI-powered platform that instantly appraises collectibles, antiques, books, and household items from a single smartphone photo. The free app combines Google's Gemini AI with gamification elements inspired by Duolingo to make treasure hunting accessible, educational, and genuinely fun.

"Most people are sitting on hundreds or thousands of dollars of hidden value and don't even know it," said Gavin McFarland, founder of RealWorth.ai. "We built RealWorth to answer the question everyone with 'stuff' has been afraid to ask: What is this actually worth?"

### The Problem: $4.4 Trillion in Untapped Value

Americans own an estimated $4.4 trillion worth of unused items sitting in closets, garages, and storage units. Traditional appraisals cost $50-200 per item, require scheduling appointments, and often feel intimidating. As a result, most people never discover what their belongings are truly worth.

### The Solution: 30-Second AI Appraisals

RealWorth users simply:
1. Take a photo of any item
2. Wait 30 seconds while playing trivia games
3. Receive a detailed valuation with market comparisons

The AI analyzes the item's era, condition, rarity, and current market demand, then provides a realistic price range based on actual sold listings from eBay, auction houses, and collector marketplaces.

### Gamification That Creates Treasure Hunters

What sets RealWorth apart is its Duolingo-style engagement system:

- **Daily Streaks**: Users build streaks by appraising items on consecutive days
- **Trivia Quizzes**: Learn fascinating facts about collectibles while waiting for results
- **Celebration Screens**: Confetti and congratulations for valuable discoveries
- **Achievements**: Unlock badges for milestones like "First $1,000 Find" or "30-Day Streak"
- **Leaderboards**: Compete with friends on total treasure value and biggest single finds

"We wanted appraisals to feel like a game, not a chore," said McFarland. "When someone discovers their grandmother's old vase is worth $500, that moment should feel magical."

### Real Results From Real Users

Early users have already made surprising discoveries:

- A $3 garage sale book turned out to be a $450 first edition
- "Just some old baseball cards" were valued at $2,847
- Inherited costume jewelry appraised at $1,200 insurance value
- Attic vinyl records worth more than a used car

### Free to Start, Pro for Power Users

RealWorth offers 10 free appraisals per month — enough to explore a box of curiosities. Pro subscribers ($9.99/month or $99/year) get unlimited appraisals plus an AI chat assistant for follow-up questions like "Where should I sell this?" or "How do I verify authenticity?"

### Availability

RealWorth.ai is available now at [realworth.ai](https://realworth.ai) on any device with a camera. The platform works on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## For Customers

### Getting Started

**Q: How does RealWorth work?**

A: RealWorth uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze photos of your items. Simply upload 1 or more images, and within 30 seconds, you'll receive a detailed appraisal including:
- Estimated value range (low to high)
- Item identification (era, origin, maker)
- Condition factors affecting value
- Step-by-step reasoning for the valuation
- Links to comparable sold items

**Q: What can I appraise?**

A: RealWorth can appraise almost anything with collectible or resale value:
- Books (first editions, rare titles, vintage)
- Collectibles (toys, cards, figurines, memorabilia)

- Art (paintings, prints, sculptures)
- Coins & Currency
- Vintage Technology (old computers, gaming consoles)
- Fashion (designer items, vintage clothing)
- Jewelry & Watches

- Tools & Equipment

**Q: How accurate are the appraisals?**

A: RealWorth provides realistic value ranges based on actual market data from eBay sold listings, auction results, and collector price guides. For common items, accuracy is typically within 10-20% of actual selling prices. For rare or unusual items, we recommend getting a second opinion from a specialist before making major decisions.

**Q: Is my item information private?**

A: Yes, by default. All appraisals are private to your account. You can choose to make specific items "public" to share with friends or appear on leaderboards. Private items are never visible to other users.

### Using the App

**Q: How do I take good photos for accurate appraisals?**

A: For best results:
- Use good lighting (natural light is best)

- Encourage daily engagement

You earn points (5/10/15 based on difficulty), and it makes the 30-second wait fly by while teaching you about the world of collecting.

**Q: What are Collections?**

A: Collections let you organize related items together. Examples:
- "Complete Harry Potter First Editions"
- "Grandma's Estate Items"
- "Garage Sale Finds 2025"

### Value & Selling

**Q: Should I trust the appraisal value?**

A: RealWorth provides estimates based on market data — think of it as a well-researched starting point. For items over $500, we recommend:
1. Use RealWorth as your first filter
2. Research sold listings yourself (eBay, auction records)
3. Consult a specialist for authentication if needed
4. Get multiple opinions before selling high-value items

**Q: Where should I sell my items?**

A: It depends on the item type and value:
- **Under $50**: Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, yard sale
- **$50-500**: eBay, Mercari, Poshmark (for fashion)
- **$500-5,000**: eBay, specialized dealers, consignment
- **$5,000+**: Auction houses, specialist dealers, authenticated marketplaces

Pro subscribers can ask the AI Chat for personalized selling advice.

**Q: Does RealWorth buy items?**

A: No, RealWorth is an appraisal tool only. We help you understand value — where and how you sell is up to you.

---

### Social Features

**Q: How do I add friends?**

A: Go to the Friends tab and:
1. Search by name or @username
2. Send a friend request
3. Wait for them to accept

Once connected, you can see each other's public items and compete on leaderboards.

**Q: What are leaderboards?**

A: RealWorth has three competitive leaderboards:
1. **Top Treasure Vaults**: Total value of all your public appraisals
2. **Biggest Single Finds**: Highest individual item values
3. **Longest Streaks**: Most consecutive days appraising

Only public items count toward leaderboards. Compete with friends or the whole community!

**Q: Can I see what my friends have appraised?**

A: You can see any items they've marked as "public" by visiting their profile. Private items are never visible to friends.

- Stored securely in Supabase cloud storage
- Only accessible by you (unless you make items public)

## For Stakeholders / Internal

### Product Strategy

**Q: Why gamification?**

A: Traditional appraisal apps have a "one and done" problem — users appraise an item, get the answer, and leave. Gamification creates multiple engagement loops:

1. **Daily streaks** → Habit formation (come back tomorrow)
2. **Trivia quizzes** → Education + entertainment (enjoy the wait)
3. **Achievements** → Progression (unlock the next milestone)
4. **Leaderboards** → Competition (beat your friends)
5. **Collections** → Goal-setting (complete the set)

This transforms appraisal from a utility into a discovery game.

**Q: Why free tier with 10 appraisals?**

A: 10/month is enough to:
- Explore and understand the product value
- Go through a box of items over time
- Get hooked before hitting the limit
- Share with friends (viral potential)

It's NOT enough to fully catalog an estate or run a reselling business — that requires Pro.

**Q: What's the target customer?**

A: Primary personas:
1. **Curious Inheritors**: "What did grandma leave me?"
2. **Thrift Store Hunters**: "Is this worth buying?"
3. **Estate Clearers**: "What should I keep vs. sell?"
4. **Casual Resellers**: "What's my profit margin?"
5. **Collectors**: "What's my collection worth now?"

Common thread: People with "stuff" who wonder about value but haven't taken action due to friction.

**Q: How does RealWorth make money?**

A: Subscription model:
- **Monthly Pro**: $9.99/month
- **Annual Pro**: $99/year (17% discount)
- **Access Codes**: Partner/influencer grants (marketing cost)

Future potential:
- Marketplace fees (if we add selling features)
- Insurance partnerships
- B2B estate/auction house tools

**Q: What's the competitive landscape?**

A: Direct competitors:
- **WorthPoint**: Subscription-based price database ($25/month) — more serious, less fun
- **Kovels**: Traditional price guide (old school)
- **eBay Sold Listings**: Free but requires manual research

Indirect competitors:
- Google Image Search (unreliable)
- Reddit communities (slow, inconsistent)
- Local appraisers (expensive, inconvenient)

RealWorth differentiates on: speed (30 seconds), gamification (engagement), and accessibility (free to start).

### Technical

**Q: What AI powers RealWorth?**

A: Google Gemini models:
- **gemini-3-pro-preview**: Main appraisal analysis (text + vision)
- **gemini-3-pro-image-preview**: Image enhancement/regeneration

We use structured JSON output to ensure consistent, parseable results.

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**

A: Accuracy varies by category:
- **Books**: Very high (ISBNs, first edition markers well-documented)
- **Toys/Collectibles**: High (extensive eBay sold data)
- **Art**: Moderate (subjective, provenance matters)
- **Rare items**: Lower (limited comparables)

We always provide a range, not a single number, and include reasoning transparency.

**Q: What's the tech stack?**

A:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Auth/DB/Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe (subscriptions, webhooks)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (120s timeout for AI operations)

**Q: What about scaling?**

A: Current architecture handles:
- Supabase free tier → Scales to Pro as needed
- Vercel serverless → Auto-scales with traffic
- Gemini API → Rate-limited by Google (can request increases)

No infrastructure changes needed until 10,000+ DAU.
