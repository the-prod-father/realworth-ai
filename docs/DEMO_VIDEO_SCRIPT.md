## SCENE 2: The Problem (0:12 - 0:30)
**[Screen: Show Google search for "how to appraise antiques" - lots of confusing results]**

**[Screen: Show a cluttered closet or garage photo]**

> *"Meanwhile, most of us have boxes of... stuff. Inherited things. Garage sale finds. That weird thing from your grandmother you've always been curious about."*

## Recording Tips

### Voice
- Speak naturally, like you're showing a friend
- Slight excitement when revealing values
- Genuine curiosity throughout

### Pacing
- Pause briefly when showing results (let them read)
- Speed up slightly during upload/loading
- Slow down for the "aha" moment

### Visuals
- Keep mouse movements smooth and intentional
- Zoom in on key information (browser zoom is fine)
- Use a real item that has an interesting result

### Editing (Optional)
- Cut dead time during upload if needed
- Add subtle background music (upbeat, curious)
- Consider adding text overlays for key stats

## Alternative Hooks (Pick Your Favorite)

**Inheritance Angle:**
> *"When my grandmother passed, she left behind 40 years of... stuff. I had no idea what was treasure and what was trash. Until I found this."*

**Garage Sale Angle:**
> *"I bought this for $3 at a garage sale. Turns out, it's worth over $200."*

**Curiosity Angle:**
> *"You know that thing you've always wondered about? The one in the back of your closet? What if you could finally know what it's worth?"*

**Speed Angle:**
> *"Expert appraisals take days and cost $50+. This takes 30 seconds and starts free."*

## B-Roll Suggestions (If Editing)
